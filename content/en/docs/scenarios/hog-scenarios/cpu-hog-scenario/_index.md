## Overview

The CPU Hog scenario is designed to create CPU pressure on one or more nodes in your Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster for a specified duration. This scenario helps you test how your cluster and applications respond to high CPU utilization.

## How It Works

The scenario deploys a stress workload pod on targeted nodes. These pods use [stress-ng](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng) to consume CPU resources according to your configuration. The workload runs for a specified duration and then terminates, allowing you to observe your cluster's behavior under CPU stress.

## When to Use

Use the CPU Hog scenario to:
- Test your cluster's ability to handle CPU resource contention
- Validate that CPU resource limits and quotas are properly configured
- Evaluate the impact of CPU pressure on application performance
- Test whether your monitoring and alerting systems properly detect CPU saturation
- Verify that the Kubernetes scheduler correctly handles CPU-constrained nodes
- Simulate scenarios where rogue pods consume excessive CPU without limits

## Key Configuration Options

In addition to the [common hog scenario options](../_index.md#common-options), CPU Hog scenarios support:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `cpu-load-percentage` | number | The percentage of CPU that will be consumed by the hog |
| `cpu-method` | string | The CPU load strategy adopted by stress-ng (see stress-ng documentation for available options) |

## Usage

Select your deployment method to get started:

- [CPU Hog using Krkn](cpu-hog-scenario-krkn.md) - Configuration for direct Krkn usage
- [CPU Hog using Krknctl](cpu-hog-scenario-krknctl.md) - Configuration for Krknctl CLI
- [CPU Hog using Krkn-Hub](cpu-hog-scenario-krkn-hub.md) - Configuration for Krkn-Hub
