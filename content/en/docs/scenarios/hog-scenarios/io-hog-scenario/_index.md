<krkn-hub-scenario id="node-io-hog">

## Overview

The IO Hog scenario is designed to create disk I/O pressure on one or more nodes in your Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster for a specified duration. This scenario helps you test how your cluster and applications respond to high disk I/O utilization and storage-related bottlenecks.

## How It Works

The scenario deploys a stress workload pod on targeted nodes. These pods use [stress-ng](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng) to perform intensive write operations to disk, consuming I/O resources according to your configuration. The scenario supports attaching node paths to the pod as a `hostPath` volume or using custom pod volume definitions, allowing you to test I/O pressure on specific storage targets.

## When to Use

Use the IO Hog scenario to:
- Test your cluster's behavior under disk I/O pressure
- Validate that I/O resource limits are properly configured
- Evaluate the impact of disk I/O contention on application performance
- Test whether your monitoring systems properly detect disk saturation
- Verify that storage performance meets requirements under stress
- Simulate scenarios where pods perform excessive disk writes
- Test the resilience of persistent volume configurations
- Validate disk I/O quotas and rate limiting

## Key Configuration Options

In addition to the [common hog scenario options](../_index.md#common-options), IO Hog scenarios support:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `io-block-size` | string | The size of each individual write operation performed by the stressor |
| `io-write-bytes` | string | The total amount of data that will be written by the stressor. Can be specified as a percentage (%) of free space on the filesystem or in absolute units (b, k, m, g for Bytes, KBytes, MBytes, GBytes) |
| `io-target-pod-folder` | string | The path within the pod where the volume will be mounted |
| `io-target-pod-volume` | dictionary | The pod volume definition that will be stressed by the scenario (typically a `hostPath` volume) |

{{< notice type="warning" >}}Modifying the structure of `io-target-pod-volume` might alter how the hog operates, potentially rendering it ineffective.{{< /notice >}}

### Example Values
- `io-block-size: "1m"` - Write in 1 megabyte blocks
- `io-block-size: "4k"` - Write in 4 kilobyte blocks
- `io-write-bytes: "50%"` - Write data equal to 50% of available free space
- `io-write-bytes: "10g"` - Write 10 gigabytes of data
